                getBoarded Developer APIs are used to manage and enhance contact information.
                Use our APIs to provide social profiles in your app, improve contacts in address books,
                enrich CRM information, or create highly personalized marketing campaigns.
                getBoarded exposes its data via an Application Programming Interface (API),
                so developers can interact in a programmatic way with the getBoarded application.
                This document is the official reference for that functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our APIs are RESTful. Responses are delivered in JSON format with most endpoints also
                providing support for XML format. Some endpoints support HTML formatted responses.

            <h3>Authentication</h3>
            <p>
                All requests to all endpoints require you to specify your unique API key.
                The API Key is assigned to you by getBoarded and is used to identify and authorize each request.
                Your API key should be kept private, and should never be displayed publicly.

            </p>
            <p>
                getBoarded supports an alternative means for authentication, which is by specifying the API key
                in the query parameter in the form of <b>apiKey=</b> . Keep in mind that we recommend use of the HTTP header
                field rather than the apiKey query parameter as it provides an added level of security.
                Although we utilize HTTPS to ensure that all requests are encrypted for network transport,
                there is a possibility that the plain-text URI, with the value of the apiKey, might appear
                in logs of HTTP servers which process the requests. Additionally, there are spyware exploits whereby
                certain browser extensions track and aggregate browsing behavior and sell that data to third parties,
                again use of <b>apiKey</b> as a query parameter could lend itself to unintentional exposure of your API key.
            </p>
            <div class="note">
                <div class="heading">NOTE</div>
                Only use query parameter based authentication for testing purposes, and first ensure you don’t have browser
                extensions that are tracking your browser history! Browser extensions have access to every URL you open
                and you could inadvertently expose your API key.
            </div>
            <p>
                For additional security, getBoarded supports an enterprise level feature called Mutual Authentication.
                Please contact your account manager for more details.

                    Solutions should not call the GetBoarded API suite using client-side javascript.
                    Doing so will expose your API key to users of your application. It’s recommended thatyou build a
                    server-side endpoint to proxy traffic to and from the getBoarded API if direct access is necessary.

            <p>
                All successful responses are returned in JSON, XML, HTML or vCard, depending on the response format you request.
                On our paid endpoints, such as the Person, Card Reader , and Disposable Email endpoints, only queries that respond
                with a 200 response code (successfully completed), are counted towards monthly allowances and overages.

            <h3>Rate Limiting</h3>
            <p>
                All API requests are subject to rate limits that exist independently of your API key's monthly usage allowance.
                We track rate-limits on a 60-second basis. For example, if your API is subject to a 10/second rate limit, we'll
                allow you 600 requests per 60 second window. To make it easier for your application to determine if it is being
                rate-limited, or if it is likely to be in the future, we've added the following HTTP headers to successful responses:
